 #  DSA - Data Structures and Algorithms
 DSA stands for data structures and algorithms. It refers to the study and implementation of various data types. It involves the orgianization, management and manipulation techniques to solve computational problems.
 # Data Structures
 Some common data structures are:
 1. Arrays- fundamental data structure that stores a collection of elements of same data type in contiguous memory locations
 2. Linkedlists- is a dynamic data structure in which elements are stored as separate objects and each element ("node") conatins a reference ("link") to the next node
 3. Stacks- follows Last-In-First-Out(LIFO) mechanism,meaning last element added would be the first one to be removed.
 4. Queues-a Fisrt-in-First-Out(FIFO) dsa,implies that the first element added will be the first to be removed.
 5. Trees-used to represent hierachial relationships between elements. Types of trees;binary,trie,b-tree
 6. Hash tables- provides efficient storage,search,insertion,and deletion operations
 7. Graphs- a non linear data structure consisting of nodes(vertices) connected by edges.

# Types of DSA in Python
## Sorting Algorithms 
1. Bubble Sort - is a simple sorting algorithm that works repeatedly iterating through a list of elements,comparing the adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

2. Insertion Sort- is a sorting algorithm that works by dividing input into a sorted and unsorted region.Each subsequent element from the unsorted region is inserted into sorted region as its correct position.To know more about this visit the website

3. Merge Sort- it uses divide-and-conquer technique to sort arrays. To know more about the same
